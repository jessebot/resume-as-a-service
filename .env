REACT_APP_BLURB="I'm a DevOps engineer who's always looking for a fun project. I can get your CI/CD setup, create tool sets, and automate anything else you need. Python is my weapon of choice, and Linux remains my valiant companion. Together we navigate the dark waters of Kubernetes, and conquer the Docker whale! I am excellent at relieving developer headaches due to tedious technical tasks, and I can also help your diversity and inclusion efforts!"
